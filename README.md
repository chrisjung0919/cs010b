# ðŸ§® CS010B â€“ Intermediate C++ Programming Projects

This repository contains my coursework from **CS010B at the University of California, Riverside**, completed during my first year as a Computer Science major. The class built upon the fundamentals of C++ programming, introducing more advanced topics like classes, recursion, and polymorphism.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

Through these labs and programs, I developed stronger coding skills in:
- Designing and using **custom classes**
- Mastering **file I/O** with different data formats
- Implementing **recursion** in practical scenarios
- Using **arrays**, **vectors**, and **linked lists**
- Understanding **polymorphism** and inheritance
- Working with class encapsulation, constructors, and overloading
